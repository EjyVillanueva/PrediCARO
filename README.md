# PrediCARO: A Game of Truth

## Designing the Program
  “PrediCARO” is a simple logic game. The rules are simple, there are falling logical
expressions and the player must decide whether the falling logical expression is true or false. They must click ‘t’ on their keyboard if the expression and ‘f’ otherwise. If the statement reaches the bottom or the player inputted an incorrect answer, it is game over.



## Engine
The game was designed and made using Python 3. The following functions were defined for
the game to be played:
